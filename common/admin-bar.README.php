  // By default, Omeka will display an admin bar when a logged-in user views
  // an exhibition. This admin bar is created by the code in 
  // application/views/scripts/common/admin-bar.php
  // In case users complain about the bar, or find it confusing, it can be
  // removed by renaming this current file (admin-bar.README.php) with the
  // following name: admin-bar.php . This file will supersede the admin-bar.php
  // file in application/views/scripts/common, thus removing the admin bar.
